The NZPC is an annual contest, usually held in August or September, and open to all programmers in New Zealand.
Teams from outside New Zealand may usually enter the SPAR contest (formerly the ANZAC League) which runs at the same time and uses the same problem set.

Team formally register at the start of the contest, but once registration is open (2-3 weeks before the contest), team managers may reserve places for their teams. [Registration Page](/register/)

## Outline

The contest is for teams of up to 3 contestants who have 5 hours to solve problems on a single computer.

To solve a problem, a team must write a solution in one of the available languages (usually C#, C++, Java and Python)
and submit it to the automatic judging system.  If this solution gives the same output to all test cases as does the judge's
solution, then the problem is considered solved.

In the NZPC, problems are graded. Solved problems score 3, 10, 30 or 100 points according to their difficulty as decided by the judges.

In each category, the team with the most points wins.  Where equal, places are decided by the time taken to arrive at a solution.

The [Results](/results/) page shows winners, scoreboards and problems from the most recent contests.
