Teams from outside New Zealand may usually enter the <a href=https://sppcontests.org/spar/>SPAR</a> contest (formerly the ANZAC League) which runs at the same time and uses the same problem set.</p><h2 id=categories>Categories</h2><p>There are <a href=/categories/>5 categories</a> under which teams may compete, each category having its own winner. The categories range from school pupils to professional programmers.</p><h2 id=sites>Sites</h2><p>Teams must compete at one of the <a href=/sites/>official sites</a>, although we will be flexible if any part of New Zealand is in lockdown.</p><p>Teams formally register at the start of the contest, but once registration is open (2-3 weeks before the contest), team managers may reserve places for their teams using the <a href=/register/>Registration Page</a>.</p><h2 id=outline>Outline</h2><p>The contest is for teams of up to 3 contestants who have 5 hours to solve problems on a single computer.</p><p>To solve a problem, a team must write a solution in one of the available languages (usually C#, C++, Java and Python)
and submit it to the automatic judging system. If this solution gives the same output to all test cases as does the judge&rsquo;s
solution, then the problem is considered solved.</p><p>In the NZPC, problems are graded. Solved problems score 3, 10, 30 or 100 points according to their difficulty as decided by the judges.</p><p>In each category, the team with the most points wins. Where equal, places are decided by the time taken to arrive at a solution.</p><p>The <a href=/results/>Results</a> page shows winners, scoreboards and problems from the most recent contests.</p></main><footer class="bg-primary text-bg-primary d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center py-3 my-4 border-top"><ul class="container list-unstyled"><li>Copyright Â© 2023 to 2025 New Zealand Programming Contest.</li><li>Webmaster Phil Robbins.</li></ul></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-cuYeSxntonz0PPNlHhBs68uyIAVpIIOZZ5JqeqvYYIcEL727kskC66kF92t6Xl2V crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
