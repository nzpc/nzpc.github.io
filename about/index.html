Teams from outside New Zealand may enter the ANZAC League which runs at the same time and uses the same problem set.</p><h2 id=categories>Categories</h2><p>There are 5 categories under which teams may compete, each category having its own winner. The categories range from school pupils to professional programmers.
<a href=/categories/>Category Details</a></p><h2 id=sites>Sites</h2><p>Teams must compete at one of the official sites, although we will be flexible if any part of New Zealand is in lockdown.
<a href=/sites/>Site Details</a></p><h2 id=outline>Outline</h2><p>The contest is for teams of up to 3 contestants who have 5 hours to solve problems on a single computer.</p><p>To solve a problem, a team must write a solution in one of the available languages (usually C#, C++, Java and Python)
and submit it to the automatic judging system. If this solution gives the same output to all test cases as does the judge&rsquo;s
solution, then the problem is considered solved.</p><p>In the NZPC, problems are graded. Solved problems score 3, 10, 30 or 100 points according to their difficulty as decided by the judges.</p><p>In each category, the team with the most points wins. Where equal, places are decided by the time taken to arrive at a solution.</p><p>The Results page show winners, scoreboards and problems from the most recent contest.
