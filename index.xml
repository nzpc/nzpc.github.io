You may like to complete a team entry form&amp;nbsp;for each team so they have the details they need for contest day.
Reserve places for your teams as shown on this table.
Most sites need to know how many teams they are expecting so they can print problem sets, manage labs and budget for refreshments.
For the 3 sites that ask team managers to email the site director, please include the number of teams you expect to enter as well as your contact details.</description></item><item><title>Contest Registration</title><link>https://nzpc.github.io/xindex/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 10:15:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nzpc.github.io/xindex/</guid><description>The New Zealand Programming Contest is today, 14:00 to 19:00.
